Program 3 planning

Driver.cpp
Tree class -- normal BST
Data class -- reuse Books

Conceit here is that we could implement the resorting 
by title, author f/l name, and publish date

To do this, could:
- Create 4 trees out of the same nodes and give 
    each node a bunch of ptr options
- Use one tree and build a new one/ discard old each
    resort. (Hopefully this could help rebalance)

Also could implement rebalancing. Would be convenient, 
but tricky to figure out.

Implement file save/ upload so can work with more books.
